# PHPUnit-Koans
PHP [Testing Koans](http://blog.code-cop.org/2015/12/testing-koans.html) to understand how to write unit tests with [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/).

## Assignment ##

* Install [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
	- Locally: 
		- `curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php`
	- Globally:
		- `curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php`
		- `sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer`

* Run `phpunit` (or `vendor/bin/phpunit`), you should see no assertions.
* Go through the test code starting from Session 1:
    * All assertions are commented and incomplete.
    * Uncomment the assertions and complete them making the tests pass.
